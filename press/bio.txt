Quidbop makes music both for your soul and your feet, aiming to give the listener a glimpse into the transcendent and unknown. His sound consists of high doses of house and techno, but almost anything is possible when his hands are on the crossfader: his sets oscillate between psychedelia, soul or cosmic funk all blended into impressive dancefloor narratives. Szabolcs Demeter got his first synthesizer at the age of 6. After playing in many bands, he got into producing electronic music in 2010. The next logical step for him was to abandon the reliance on other people’s records altogether. Since then quidbop has been creating his own compositions and playing live sets where he can remix them on the fly.

Not so restricted by tempo, quidbop’s sound moves you between clubs and clouds. His approach to music is playful, with odd beats and polyrhythms sampled from all over the place: from foley sounds to Youtube digging. After releasing his self-titled debut album in 2017, he performed live acts on online music shows such as Balcony TV and Sofar Sounds.

His love for DIY ethic is well-known, but after he found out that his ambition reaches much farther than 120 beats per minute, quidbop got into building synths, creating devices that just don’t exist in the commercial marketplace.
